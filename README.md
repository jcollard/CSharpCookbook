## [Common Errors](CommonErrors.md)

This is a collection of all the errors that appear in the Cookbook. If you have
an error message, you can look it up by it's error number here and find links to
relevant sections within the Cookbook.

## [Local Variables](LocalVariables.md)

A variable allows a programmer to manage the complexity of a program by naming a
location in memory.

In C#, there are two types of variables: local variables and member variables.
This section discusses local variables.

## [If Statements](IfStatements.md)

An if statement is a programming construct that we use to create selections
within a program. Closely coupled with the `if` statement is the `else`
statement which can be used to create a "this" or "that" selection.
